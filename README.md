# Easy21

This is my implementation of the assignment on the Reinforcement Learning course at UCL
given by David Silver. 

The project is focused on a game similar to Blackjack called Easy21. A number of Reinforcement
Learning algorithms are implemented to train an agent to play Easy21
against a dealer. A full description of the game can be found in the [pdf](Easy21-Johannes.pdf).

A [Jupyter notebook](Easy21.ipynb) shows output from the code to address the problems in the pdf.
